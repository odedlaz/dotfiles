# My dotfiles

This repository holds my configuration files for:

* neovim
* tmux
* fish

I think they're awesome and they took a long time for me to get right.  
They're still a work in progress, so visit this page every now and then!

## neovim note

my neovim configuration uses `vim.plug` exclusively, head over to [vim-plug](https://www.google.cdio://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to start.
